With the **DiagrammeR** package, you can create easily graph diagrams using **R**. You can either use **Markdown**-like text to describe and render a diagram, or, use a collection of functions to create graph objects from **R** objects and render/export at will. The output can be viewed in the **RStudio** Viewer, it can be incorporated in **R Markdown**, and it can be integrated in **shiny** web apps. Because we are doing this in **R** we can and always should add much more **R** code into the mix.

Go to the [**project website**](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/) and view a video walkthrough for a graph diagram that's created with a few lines of text and is just as easily customizable. After being all fired up from that intense video-tutorial extravaganza, have a look at the [**DiagrammeR Docs**](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/docs.html) to learn more.

## Creating Graphviz Graphs

It's possible to make single graph diagrams using the **Graphviz** support included in package. Simply specify a valid **Graphviz** graph in the **DOT** language either in the form of a string, a reference to a **Graphviz** file (with a **.gv** file extension), or as a text connection.

Here is an example where nodes (in this case styled as rectangles and circles) can be easily defined along with their connections:

<img src="inst/img/grViz.png">
```r
grViz("
digraph {
  
  # graph attributes
  graph [overlap = true]
  
  # node attributes
  node [shape = box,
        fontname = Helvetica,
        color = blue]
  
  # edge attributes
  edge [color = gray]
  
  # node statements
  A; B; C; D; E
  F [color = black]
  
  # node attributes
  node [shape = circle,
        fixedsize = true,
        width = 0.9]
  
  # node statements
  1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8

  # edge statements
  A->1; B->2                   // gray
  B->3 [color = red]           // red
  B->4                         // gray
  C->A [color = green]         // green
  1->D; E->A; 2->4; 1->5; 1->F // gray
  E->6; 4->6; 5->7; 6->7       // gray
  3->8 [color = blue]          // blue
}
")
```

There is a great variety of ways to style the nodes and edges in a **Graphviz** graph diagram. Also, the layout of a graph can changed by using the **neato**, **twopi**, and **circo** rendering engines.

This only scratches the surface. At [DiagrammeR Docs](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/graphviz.html), you can learn quite a lot more about this.

## Using DiagrammeR Functions to Define Graphs

In the last example you saw what was essentially a text string being passed into a single function. That's not very **R**-like, is it? Well, it's a good thing that there's a collection of graph functions available for creating and manipulating graphs (specifically, graph objects). They allow you to generate node and edge data frames (collections of nodes or edges along with their attributes), perform scaling of attribute values with data values, create graph objects, render those graphs, modify those graphs, get information from the graphs, create a series of graphs, and... so much more.

<img src="inst/img/DiagrammeR_graph_functions.png">

With the graph-building functions, it's possible to generate a graph with data available in a data frame. The general idea is to build specialized data frames for that contain either node data and attributes (node data frames) and those data frames that contain edge data and edge attributes (edge data frames). These data frames are permitted to have columns of arbitrary data alongside columns named for node or edge attributes. Because metadata can exist alongside the node and edge definitions, we can easily scale the values of the styling attributes and thus enable a highly visual means to differentiate nodes and edges by size, color, shape, opacity, length, etc.

Here is a simple workflow for building and rendering a graph object:

## An Example with Data from the **nycflights13** Package

Using the `flights` dataset from the **nycflights13** **R** package, create a graph diagram. Here, the green lines show flights that weren't late arriving at their destinations (red indicates those late arrivals). Things to note are:

- the use of other packages to modify a data frame (because we are using **R**, after all)
- piped expressions with the `pipeR` package (the **DiagrammeR** functions are very pipe-able)
- the `circo` layout for the graph (it's a nice circular arrangement of nodes)
