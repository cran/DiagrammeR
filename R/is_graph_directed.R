#' Is the graph a directed graph?
#'
#' Determines whether a graph is set to be directed or not and returns a logical
#' value to that effect.

#'
#' @return A logical value.

#' # new graphs made by `create_graph()`
#' # are directed

#' # Determine whether the graph
#' # is directed

#' # Use the `set_graph_undirected()`
#' # function and check again whether
#' # the graph is directed
