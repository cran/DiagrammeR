#' Is the graph an undirected graph?
#'
#' Determines whether a graph is set as undirected or not and returns a logical
#' value to that effect.
#'
#' @inheritParams render_graph
#'
#' @return A logical value.
#'
#' @examples
#' # Create an empty graph; by
#' # default, new graphs made
#' # by `create_graph()` are
#' # directed graph, so, use
#' # `directed = FALSE` to create
#' # an undirected graph
#' graph <-
#'   create_graph(
#'     directed = FALSE)
#'
#' # Determine whether the
#' # graph is undirected
#' graph %>% is_graph_undirected()
#'
#' # Use the `set_graph_directed()`
#' # function and check again
#' # as to whether the graph is
#' # undirected
#' graph %>%
#'   set_graph_directed() %>%
#'   is_graph_undirected()
