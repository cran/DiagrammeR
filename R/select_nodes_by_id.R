#' Select nodes in a graph by ID values
#' @description Select nodes in a graph object of class
#' \code{dgr_graph} by their node ID values. If nodes
#' have IDs that are monotonically increasing integer
#' values, then numeric ranges can be used for the
#' selection.
#' @param graph a graph object of class
#' \code{dgr_graph}.
#' @param nodes a vector of node IDs for the selection
#' of nodes present in the graph.
#' @param set_op the set operation to perform upon
#' consecutive selections of graph nodes. This can
#' either be as a \code{union} (the default), as an
#' intersection of selections with \code{intersect},
#' or, as a \code{difference} on the previous
#' selection, if it exists.
#' @return a graph object of class \code{dgr_graph}.
