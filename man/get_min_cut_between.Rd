\title{Get the minimum cut between source and sink nodes}
\usage{
get_min_cut_between(graph, from, to)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A graph object of class \code{dgr_graph}.}

\item{from}{The node ID for the source node.}

\item{to}{The node ID for the sink or target node.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the minimum total edge capacity
removed to disconnect the source and sink nodes.
}
\description{
Get the minimum cut between source and sink nodes. This is the minimum total
capacity of edges needed for removal in order to eliminate all paths from the
source and sink nodes.
