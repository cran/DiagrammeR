\title{Get the minimum cut between source and sink nodes}
\usage{
get_min_cut_between(graph, from, to)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{a graph object of class
\code{dgr_graph}.}

\item{from}{the node ID for the source node.}

\item{to}{the node ID for the sink or target node.}
}
\value{
a single numeric value representing the
minimum total edge capacity removed to disconnect
the source and sink nodes.
}
\description{
Get the minimum cut between source
and sink nodes. This is the minimum total capacity
of edges needed for removal in order to eliminate
all paths from the source and sink nodes.
