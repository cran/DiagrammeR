\title{Get all nodes associated with connected components}
\usage{
get_w_connected_cmpts(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{a graph object of class
\code{dgr_graph}.}
}
\value{
a data frame with nodes and their membership
in different weakly connected components.
}
\description{
Determine which nodes in a graph belong
to different weakly connected components (i.e.,
distinct sets of nodes with traversable paths to and
from each node in the set).
}
\examples{
# Create a graph with 2 cycles
graph <-
  create_graph() \%>\%
  add_cycle(n = 4) \%>\%
  add_cycle(n = 3)

# Check if the graph is connected
is_graph_connected(graph)
#> [1] FALSE

# Get the graph's weakly-connected
# components
get_w_connected_cmpts(graph)
