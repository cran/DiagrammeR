\title{Subset a graph series object}
\usage{
subset_series(graph_series, by = "number", values, tz = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph_series}{a graph series object of type
\code{dgr_graph_1D}.}

\item{by}{either \code{number}, which allows for
subsetting of the graph series by graph indices, or
\code{time} which for graph series objects of type
\code{temporal} allows for a subsetting of graphs by
a date-time or time range.}

\item{values}{where the subsetting of the graph
series by to occur via graph indices (where
\code{by = number}), provide a vector of those
indices; when subsetting by time (where
\code{by = time}), a range of times can be provided
as a vector.}

\item{tz}{the time zone (\code{tz}) corresponding to
dates or date-time string provided in \code{values}
(if \code{by = "date"}).}
}
\value{
a graph series object of type
\code{dgr_graph_1D}.
}
\description{
Subsetting a graph series by the
graphs' index positions in the graph series or
through selection via graphs' date-time attributes.
