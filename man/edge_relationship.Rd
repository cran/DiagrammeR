\usage{
edge_relationship(graph, from, to, action = "read", value = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{a graph object of class \code{dgr_graph} that is created using \code{create_graph}.}

\item{from}{a node ID from which the edge to be queried is outgoing.}

\item{to}{a node ID to which the edge to be queried is incoming.}

\item{action}{the operation to perform on the edge's relationship attribute. To remove a relationship from an edge, use either \code{delete}, \code{remove}, or \code{drop}. To add a relationship to an edge with no set relationship, use \code{add} or \code{create}. To update an edge relationship, use \code{update}. To return the value of an edge relationship, use \code{read}. To determine whether there is a set relationship, use \code{check}.}

\item{value}{a string denoting the relationship, to be supplied when either adding or updating an edge relationship.}

\value{
a graph object of class \code{dgr_graph}.
