\title{Combine two graphs into a single graph}
\usage{
combine_graphs(x, y, edges_df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{DiagrammeR} graph object to which
another graph will be joined. This graph should be
considered the host graph as the resulting graph
will retain only the attributes of this graph.}

\item{y}{a \code{DiagrammeR} graph object that is to
be joined with the graph suppled as \code{x}.}

\item{edges_df}{an optional edge data frame that
allows for connections between nodes across the
graphs to be combined.}
}
\value{
a graph object of class \code{dgr_graph}.
}
\description{
Combine two graphs in order to make a
new graph, merging nodes and edges in the process.
The use of an optional data frame allows for new
edges to be formed across the combined graphs.
