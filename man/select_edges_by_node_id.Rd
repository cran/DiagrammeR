\title{Select edges in a graph using node ID values}
\usage{
select_edges_by_node_id(graph, nodes, set_op = "union")
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A graph object of class \code{dgr_graph}.}

\item{nodes}{A vector of node IDs for the selection of edges present in the
graph.}

\item{set_op}{The set operation to perform upon consecutive selections of
graph edges This can either be as a \code{union} (the default), as an
intersection of selections with \code{intersect}, or, as a \code{difference} on the
previous selection, if it exists.}
}
\value{
A graph object of class \code{dgr_graph}.
}
\description{
Select edges in a graph object of class \code{dgr_graph} using node ID values. All
edges associated with the provided nodes will be included in the selection.
}
\examples{
# Create a graph with 5 nodes
graph <-
  create_graph() \%>\%
  add_path(n = 5)

# Create a graph selection by selecting edges
# associated with nodes `1` and `2`
graph <-
  graph \%>\%
  select_edges_by_node_id(
    nodes = 1:2)

# Get the selection of edges
graph \%>\% get_selection()

# Perform another selection of edges, with nodes
# `1`, `2`, and `4`
graph <-
  graph \%>\%
  clear_selection() \%>\%
  select_edges_by_node_id(
    nodes = c(1, 2, 4))

# Get the selection of edges
graph \%>\% get_selection()

# Get a fraction of the edges selected over all
# the edges in the graph
graph \%>\%
  {
    l <- get_selection(.) \%>\%
      length(.)
    e <- count_edges(.)
    l/e
