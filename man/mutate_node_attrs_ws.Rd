\title{Mutate node attribute values for a selection of nodes}
\usage{
mutate_node_attrs_ws(graph, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{a graph object of class
\code{dgr_graph}.}

\item{...}{expressions used for the mutation
of node attributes. LHS of each expression is
either an existing or new node attribute name.
The RHS can consist of any valid R code that
uses node attributes as variables. Expressions
are evaluated in the order provided, so, node
attributes created or modified are ready to
use in subsequent expressions.}
}
\value{
a graph object of class
\code{dgr_graph}.
}
\description{
Within a graph's internal node
data frame (ndf), mutate node attribute
values only for nodes in a selection by
using one or more expressions.
