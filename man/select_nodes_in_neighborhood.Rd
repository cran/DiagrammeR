\title{Select nodes based on a walk distance from a
specified node}
\usage{
select_nodes_in_neighborhood(graph, node, distance, set_op = "union")
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{a graph object of class
\code{dgr_graph}.}

\item{node}{the node from which the traversal
will originate.}

\item{distance}{the maximum number of steps from
the \code{node} for inclusion in the selection.}

\item{set_op}{the set operation to perform upon
consecutive selections of graph nodes. This can
either be as a \code{union} (the default), as an
intersection of selections with \code{intersect},
or, as a \code{difference} on the previous
selection, if it exists.}
}
\value{
a graph object of class \code{dgr_graph}.
}
\description{
Select those nodes in the neighborhood
of nodes connected a specified distance from an
initial node.
}
\examples{
# Create a graph containing a balanced tree
graph <-
  create_graph() \%>\%
  add_balanced_tree(2, 3)

# Create a graph selection by selecting nodes
# in the neighborhood of node `1`, where the
# neighborhood is limited by nodes that are 1
# connection away from node `1`
graph <-
  graph \%>\%
  select_nodes_in_neighborhood(
    node = 1, distance = 1)

# Get the selection of nodes
graph \%>\% get_selection()
#> [1] 1 2 3

# Perform another selection of nodes, this time
# with a neighborhood spanning 2 nodes from node `1`
graph <-
  graph \%>\%
  clear_selection() \%>\%
  select_nodes_in_neighborhood(
    node = 1, distance = 2)

# Get the selection of nodes
graph \%>\% get_selection()
#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

# Perform a final selection of nodes, using
# `distance = 3`, this effectively selects all
# nodes in this graph
graph <-
  graph \%>\%
  clear_selection() \%>\%
  select_nodes_in_neighborhood(
    node = 1, distance = 3)

# Get the selection of nodes
graph \%>\% get_selection
#> [1] 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
