\title{Select edges in a graph using edge ID values}
\usage{
select_edges_by_edge_id(graph, edges, set_op = "union")
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A graph object of class \code{dgr_graph}.}

\item{edges}{A vector of edge IDs for the selection of edges present in the
graph.}

\item{set_op}{The set operation to perform upon consecutive selections of
graph edges This can either be as a \code{union} (the default), as an
intersection of selections with \code{intersect}, or, as a \code{difference} on the
previous selection, if it exists.}
}
\value{
A graph object of class \code{dgr_graph}.
}
\description{
Select edges in a graph object of class \code{dgr_graph} using edge ID values.
}
\examples{
# Create a graph with 5 nodes
graph <-
  create_graph() \%>\%
  add_path(n = 5)

# Create a graph selection by selecting
# edges with edge IDs `1` and `2`
graph <-
  graph \%>\%
  select_edges_by_edge_id(
    edges = 1:2)

# Get the selection of edges
graph \%>\% get_selection()

# Perform another selection of edges,
# with edge IDs `1`, `2`, and `4`
graph <-
  graph \%>\%
  clear_selection() \%>\%
  select_edges_by_edge_id(
    edges = c(1, 2, 4))

# Get the selection of edges
graph \%>\% get_selection()

# Get the fraction of edges selected
